  <h1>Welcome to Storybook for AEM</h1>
  <p>This is a UI component dev environment for your plain AEM snippets.</p>
  <p>
    We've added some basic stories inside the <code class="code">components</code> directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
